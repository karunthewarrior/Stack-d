# 16-662 ROBOT AUTONOMY PROJECT: STACKâ€™D

The goal of the project is to combine the concepts we learnt in class in areas of kinematics and controls, motion planning and computer vision to build a robot that will pick and place blocks of different shapes into a specific configuration. The required configuration will first be built by a human user and the robot will analyze the scene to determine the pose of the various blocks. The robot will then pick and place a new set of blocks in order to recreate the scene. 

This project was built using the LoCoBot platform.
