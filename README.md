# 16-662 ROBOT AUTONOMY PROJECT: STACKâ€™D

The goal of the project is to combine the concepts we learnt in class in areas of kinematics and controls, motion planning and computer vision to build a robot that will pick and place blocks of different shapes into a specific configuration. The required configuration will first be built by a human user and the robot will analyze the structure to determine the pose of the various shapes. The robot will then plan and execute a sequence of high level actions that will result in building the observed structure. In our case, structures are made to form marble tracks and after completion of the structure, the robot will drop a marble thereby causing it to run along the created track. 

Work in Progress (Expected date of completion: 1st May 2019)
